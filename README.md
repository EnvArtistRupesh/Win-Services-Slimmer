# Win_Services_Slimmer
This project houses a potent batch script designed to elegantly optimize your Windows 10/11 experience by intelligently slimming down unnecessary services and components. If you're seeking a more streamlined and efficient Windows environment, our script is tailor-made for you.

I don't know a lot about batch scripting and PowerShell commands so I grabbed some code from AveYo's script on how to launch Powershell in administrator.
